A collection of pdoc themes ready for use.

## Installation

TODO

## Available styles

Current available styles are the ones not marked with (WIP).

* [Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/index.html): a theme that's generated by `cargo doc`
* [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme): classic dracula's color scheme
* [Github](https://github.com/one-dark): github's one dark color scheme (WIP)
* [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/docs/svelte-components): a theme that's used in svelte's docs (WIP)

If you'd like to see one of those themes in action, go to their directory.

## Development
Currently the code isn't organized correctly, but i have a plan to make it simpler
to develop new themes using just `var(--color)`.
