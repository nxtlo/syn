# syn

A collection of pdoc themes ready for use.

## Installation

TODO

## Available styles

Current available styles are the ones not marked with (WIP).

* Rust: A theme that's generated by `cargo doc`
* Dracula: Classic dracula's color scheme
* Github: Github dark color scheme (WIP)
* Svelte: A theme that's used in svelte's docs (WIP)

## Development
Currently the code isn't organized correctly, but i have a plan to make it simpler
to develop new themes using just `var(--color)`.
